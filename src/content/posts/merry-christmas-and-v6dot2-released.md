title: Merry christmas! (Botfather v6.2 released)
lead: Merry christmas everyone! I finally found some time to release BF v6.2 and update the Browser documentation. Hope the changes are welcome and useful. Happy automating!
---

As teased in the previous two blog posts Botfather is now able to:

- Run multiple browser based bots at once
- Evaluate Javascript in its browsers
- Send keyboard inputs to the browser

Furthermore, there are coming a lot of fixes and tweaks with this new version.

### Donations

Currently I make no money from BF, but I have to pay for the website and domain every month. To cover these costs I added a "Buy me a coffee" button to see how that goes. If asking for donations doesn't work I'll try to add ads to the website (not the actual program).

### Botfather 7

I did some prototyping and came to the conclusion that BF7 will probably switch its scripting language to Python and see a major redesign. Python will allow script/bot developers to use existing Python packages such as Tensorflow for proper machine learning. (Yes, I tried to integrate node.js, but their embedding API is atm very poor).

Anyways, thats it from me for this year. Merry christmas to all of you. See you next year.

title: Custom Browser User Agent (version 6.6.0)
lead: Due to popular request, the Botfather browsers can now have custom user agent strings. Two new methods were added to the Browser type allowing a custom user agent string to be set and reset.

## Use case

Certain websites behaviour is based on the User Agent string the browser provides. Being able to alter the user agent string allows simulating different browsers. This is useful for testing websites or webapps which expect a custom user agent string.
